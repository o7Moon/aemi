# Under construction!
this is very new! it might be a bit until theres good instructions here, [please hold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4dbTkhj5zU).

## Uri scheme
links starting with `aemi://` will open aemi. create a link that looks something like `aemi://installmod/link/to/mod.dll` and it'll open a confirmation menu to install the linked mod. you can link a .zip as well if that's how you bundle your mod.
